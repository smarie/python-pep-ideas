# PEP ideas

In this page I plan to list all PEP ideas that I encountered while developing [various python libraries](https://github.com/smarie/ALL_OF_THE_ABOVE#python). Each idea is then detailed in the [issues page](https://github.com/smarie/python-pep-ideas/issues) for discussion.

## from [getversion](https://smarie.github.io/python-getversion/)

 * [an api to get the version of anything reliably](https://github.com/smarie/python-pep-ideas/issues)

## from [makefun](https://smarie.github.io/python-makefun)

 * [a better functools (more signature-preserving, and with more features)](https://github.com/smarie/python-pep-ideas/issues/2)
